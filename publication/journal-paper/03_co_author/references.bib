  abstract  = "Both acute aerobic (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) have been
               acknowledged to be effective methods in enhancing executive
               function and brain-related P3 amplitudes. Nevertheless, the
               effect of acute concurrent exercise training (CET), combining
               both AE and RE, on executive function remains subject to
               speculation. Moreover, investigation of the mechanisms that
               underlie improvements in executive function would facilitate
               scientific understanding. Notably, lactate has emerged as a
               candidate among several potential mechanisms. Therefore, the
               main aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of
               acute CET on the cognitive flexibility dimension of executive
               function using behavioural and neuro-electric measures. A
               secondary aim was to determine the mediating effect of blood
               lactate in the acute exercise-executive function relationship.
               Seventy-eight young adults (38 women, 40 men; 22.8 $\pm$ 1.8
               years) were randomly assigned to one of the following groups:
               CET, AE, or reading control (RC). Cognitive flexibility was
               evaluated using the Task-Switching Test and its derived
               electroencephalography (EEG) was assessed immediately prior to
               and following each treatment. Fingertip lactate assays were
               taken prior to, at the midpoint, and after each treatment. Both
               acute CET and AE shortened response time regardless of test
               conditions when compared to the RC group. Greater P3 amplitude
               was observed following CET in the heterogeneous condition and
               under AE in the switch condition. A significant mediation of
               blood lactate for response time emerged in both the CET and AE
               groups for the heterogeneous and switch conditions. The blood
               lactate mediation was not reflected in P3 amplitude. The present
               findings suggest that acute CET leads to positive behavioural
               and neuro-electric alterations of cognitive flexibility, and its
               effect is similar to AE. Additionally, blood lactate serves as a
               mediator of the effects of acute exercise on executive function
               from a behavioural, but not neuro-electric standpoint.",
