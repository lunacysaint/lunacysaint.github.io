  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Acute exercise appears to promote executive function
               (EF) in children. However, the effect of acute exercise on EF in
               children with preterm birth (PB) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To
               investigate whether acute moderate-intensity exercise improves
               EF in children with PB. METHODS: Twenty child participants with
               PB (age = 10.95 $\pm$ 1.19 years, birth age = 31.71 $\pm$ 3.64
               weeks) completed exercise and control sessions in a randomized
               crossover design. In the exercise session, participants
               completed a 30-minute period of moderate-intensity aerobic
               exercise. In the control session, participants watched a video
               for appropriately 30 min. Following each session immediately,
               inhibitory control, an aspect of EF, was assessed with the
               Numerical Stroop task. RESULTS: Response time (RT) for the
               Stroop's incongruent condition was shorter after the exercise
               session than after the control session. However, no differences
               were observed in RT for the congruent condition. Accuracy rate
               (ACC) in both congruent and incongruent conditions did not
               differ between exercise and control session. CONCLUSION: The
               findings support the beneficial effect of acute exercise on
               executive function (EF) in children with PB, particularly in
               terms of improving inhibitory control.",
