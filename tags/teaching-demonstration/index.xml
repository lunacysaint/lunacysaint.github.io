      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the course demonstration session led by Steve Ying-Chu Chen, he showcased his extensive teaching experience and demonstrated how flexible bilingual strategies in EMI (English as a Medium of Instruction) can help students engage more effectively in fields like exercise science and cognitive neuroscience. By using translanguaging, students are able to draw on their full linguistic resources to deepen their understanding and express complex ideas, while also enhancing their academic English skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ying-Chu Chen emphasized that bilingual teaching is not just about switching between languages; it&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool for promoting educational equity and global competence. When students are taught in a multilingual environment, they can develop a broader perspective, critical thinking skills, and a stronger connection to global knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar also addressed the growing importance of language equity in higher education, stressing that EMI should aim to lower language barriers so that students from diverse linguistic backgrounds can equally participate, understand, and express themselves. By balancing language use with content delivery, instructors can create a more inclusive learning environment that is both academically rigorous and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the seminar explored the future of bilingual collaboration in teaching, offering practical strategies and insights to help educators find the balance between theory and practice in EMI classrooms. Overall, the event not only showcased the diversity of bilingual education but also prompted attendees to think about how to continue advancing language inclusion and academic innovation in globalized education.&lt;/p&gt;
